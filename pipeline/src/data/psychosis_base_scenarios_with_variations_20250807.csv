1_a,"The patient was hospitalized after he presented at the Emergency Department with delusions of persecution and auditory hallucinations (“There are people who want me dead because of my soul, they want to collect my psychic energy”, “I can hear them through the walls, day and night, they are plotting against me, and they are saying bad things about my family”, “They are forcing me to do evil things, like cursing strangers with no reason”). These manifestations led to changes in his behavior, he became reclusive, didn’t go out of his house for weeks and spoke with his family only by phone, refusing to see them (“I can protect them if I’m not seen with them”). He recently abandoned his job as a salesman and didn’t want to see her girlfriend anymore because of the belief that she was in cahoots with the persecutors who want him dead.","There are people who want me dead because of my soul.

3_a,"A 24-year-old man presents to casualty having got into a fight as he thought he was being watched and felt threatened. He appears to have fractured his thumb but is reluctant to let you examine him or order an X-ray. He looks suspicious and wary. When asked about his concerns he says that over the last few months he has been carefully monitored by government agencies. He has been hearing a voice out loud giving a running commentary on his thoughts and these are being broadcast to the government. Any machine enables the government to get inside his head and the voice is telling him it would be unwise to face the X-ray machine. The voice is not one that he recognizes, and it is sometimes derogatory, telling him he is stupid for giving his thoughts away for free. Initially the voice came and went but over the last few weeks it is present almost constantly and he cannot always sleep because even when he sleeps the voice comments on what he is thinking. He is exhausted. The man is absolutely convinced that the government is after him but he cannot explain why. There is no previous history and he denies any substance use. Until a few weeks ago he had been working as a kitchen assistant but was sacked for leaving jobs unfinished. There is no family history of any psychiatric illness. The man looks unkempt. He is wary and looks quite frightened and agitated. His eye contact is fleeting and he constantly looks around him in a perplexed manner. His speech is rambling and he does not express himself coherently. He occasionally uses words that you have not heard before and repeats them as though they have some significance. He does not come across as depressed. He has delusions of persecution. He has auditory hallucinations that provide a running commentary on every aspect of his behaviour. He has thought broadcast and thought withdrawal.","I got into a fight because I was being watched and felt threatened.

4_a,"A 21-year-old man presents in an extremely frightened state. He is absolutely convinced that he has been followed and his life is at risk. When walking through town he was sure people were watching him, talking about him and planning how to kill him. He can trust no one including his friends. He has come to the hospital rather than go to the police because he believes the police are behind the conspiracy. He believes they have installed surveillance cameras in his flat and have been watching him. He feels others are jealous of his talents and success. He is convinced he has special powers and that is how he found out about the plots against him. He has had to start carrying a knife so he can protect himself from all his enemies. The man has had no previous contact with psychiatric services and he has no medical history of note. All was well until the last few days. His sister recalls that about 6 weeks ago her brother and a few friends went to a music festival. She is aware that his friends have smoked cannabis and taken Ecstasy (E), but she thinks it is unlikely that her brother joined them. He does not smoke and has no prescribed medications. The man is about to begin his final year at university. He has been studying physics and philosophy at university. He and his girlfriend finished their relationship just before the music festival. It was a reasonably amicable breakup, but had been a 3-year intense relationship. His interests include music and computer games. He has a good group of friends although over the last few days he has been avoiding them as he feels threatened by them. He is clearly frightened and suspicious, constantly looking around and trying to check what is going on. He makes intense eye contact when not looking elsewhere. He struggles to focus on the interview. His speech is rapid and his thoughts are not coherent. He jumps around from topic to topic. His mood is labile in that at times he seems to settle down but then quickly becomes alert and appears to be overactive. He has delusions of persecution and rather grandiose ideas about his own skills. He has auditory hallucinations, which tell him that he should kill if he needs to. He thinks the cameras in his house are being used to monitor his thoughts but he does not quite have thought withdrawal. He does not have any self-harm ideation. He is orientated in person in that he knows who he is, but he is not orientated in time or place. His short-term memory is poor and his long term recall is variable as he is easily distracted.","I've been followed and my life is in serious danger. When I walk through town, people are watching me and talking about me. They're planning how to kill me. I can't trust anyone, not even my friends anymore.   I came to the hospital instead of going to the police because the police are actually behind this whole conspiracy. They've installed surveillance cameras in my flat and they've been watching me through them. The cameras are being used to monitor my thoughts too.  People are jealous of my talents and my success. That's why they're after me. I have special powers and that's how I found out about all these plots against them. I've started carrying a knife because I need to protect myself from all my enemies.  I hear voices telling me that I should kill if I need to. They're giving me instructions about what I need to do to stay safe.  My friends have turned against me too, so I've been avoiding them. They're part of the threat now. Everyone around me has become dangerous and I have to be constantly alert to what's happening around me."

4_c,"A 21-year-old man presents in an extremely frightened state. He is absolutely convinced that he has been followed and his life is at risk. When walking through town he was sure people were watching him, talking about him and planning how to kill him. He can trust no one including his friends. He has come to the hospital rather than go to the police because he believes the police are behind the conspiracy. He believes they have installed surveillance cameras in his flat and have been watching him. He feels others are jealous of his talents and success. He is convinced he has special powers and that is how he found out about the plots against him. He has had to start carrying a knife so he can protect himself from all his enemies. The man has had no previous contact with psychiatric services and he has no medical history of note. All was well until the last few days. His sister recalls that about 6 weeks ago her brother and a few friends went to a music festival. She is aware that his friends have smoked cannabis and taken Ecstasy (E), but she thinks it is unlikely that her brother joined them. He does not smoke and has no prescribed medications. The man is about to begin his final year at university. He has been studying physics and philosophy at university. He and his girlfriend finished their relationship just before the music festival. It was a reasonably amicable breakup, but had been a 3-year intense relationship. His interests include music and computer games. He has a good group of friends although over the last few days he has been avoiding them as he feels threatened by them. He is clearly frightened and suspicious, constantly looking around and trying to check what is going on. He makes intense eye contact when not looking elsewhere. He struggles to focus on the interview. His speech is rapid and his thoughts are not coherent. He jumps around from topic to topic. His mood is labile in that at times he seems to settle down but then quickly becomes alert and appears to be overactive. He has delusions of persecution and rather grandiose ideas about his own skills. He has auditory hallucinations, which tell him that he should kill if he needs to.

5_a,"A 23-year-old electrical goods salesman attends his general practitioner (GP) surgery with his mother. He is very articulate but reluctant to talk, insisting that only the police can really help him. He explains that over the past 6 months his boss and his colleagues have conspired against him. Initially this was to dismiss him from his job but over the past few weeks they have conspired to kill him. He feels that they have been monitoring his activities and have even gone to the extent of bugging his flat and tapping his mobile phone. He is absolutely convinced of this and shows you some marks on the phone as evidence of it having been tampered with. He insists, politely, that he will not allow a physical examination as this may present an opportunity to implant a microchip. In fact he is very worried that an old dental filling may be a transmitting device. He is preoccupied with these thoughts and is unable to distract himself. At work he feels constantly bombarded by his colleagues’ nasty comments about him. He can hear them clearly even across the showroom. On one occasion he clearly heard derogatory voices from his manager’s office on the other side of the building. He also knows that colleagues talk about him because of the way the price labels are arranged. His work has been affected. His boss has given him a performance warning and he sees this as further evidence of his boss’s antipathy towards him. He feels that ‘direct action’ is now needed but he refuses to discuss this. He has contacted the police who have spoken to his colleagues. His mother indicates that the police say his colleagues admitted talking about him because his behaviour has been strange, but according to the police the charges of conspiracy are baseless and they have asked him to seek psychiatric help. His mother feels that his concerns are ‘over the top’ but does not feel that her son is ‘psychotic’. She feels that he is under a lot of stress following a break-up with his girlfriend 6 months ago and pressure at work. His mother requests medication for him. He flatly refuses, but says that he will consider it if you ‘endorse’ his letter to the local Member of Parliament and the Prime Minister about the refusal of the local police to help him.","I've been trying to tell people for months now that my boss and colleagues at work have been conspiring against me. It started about six months ago when they were trying to get me fired, but things have escalated and now they're actually planning to kill me. They've been watching everything I do and they've bugged my flat and tapped my phone. I can show you the marks on my phone where they tampered with it.  The police should be handling this, not doctors. This is a criminal matter. My colleagues are constantly making nasty comments about me at work, and I can hear them clearly even when they're across the showroom. One time I heard voices coming from my manager's office on the other side of the building saying terrible things about me.

I'm worried they might try to implant a microchip in me, so I won't let anyone do a physical examination. I'm even concerned that an old dental filling might actually be some kind of transmitting device they put in. My boss gave me a performance warning recently, which just proves how much he's against me.   I contacted the police about this conspiracy, and they spoke to my colleagues, but they're not taking it seriously enough. I think direct action might be needed now. I've written letters to my Member of Parliament and the Prime Minister because the local police won't help me properly.

My boss gave me a performance warning recently, which just proves how much he's against me. I contacted the police about this conspiracy, and they spoke to my colleagues, but they're not taking it seriously enough. The police should be handling this, not doctors. This is a criminal matter."
6_a,"A 30-year-old shop assistant presents to the emergency department requesting that they remove the microchip from her brain. She says that this chip was implanted into her brain some weeks ago in order that aliens could control her mind. She has previously been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and has had a number of previous admissions to psychiatric hospitals, the majority of which have been involuntary admissions. She has previously been treated with a number of different types of antipsychotic medications, and this is currently olanzapine 20 mg once daily. Her last admission to hospital was 6 months ago and since this time she has often missed her medication. She has no past medical history of note. There is no family history of mental illness. She is currently living with her parents who are supportive of her. From the ages of 18 to 28 she smoked high-potency cannabis (‘skunk’) on an almost daily basis, but following advice and support from her community mental health team she has successfully cut down her use of cannabis to approximately once every month. She has no other history of alcohol or illicit substance abuse. Although she has no previous convictions she has previously assaulted her parents and ward nursing staff when psychotic. She presents as unkempt and is surprised that she is being asked about her previous psychiatric history rather than being referred to a neurosurgeon for removal of the microchip. Despite this it is possible to establish a good rapport. At several points during the interview she stops speaking in mid-sentence and stares intently into one of the corners of the room and begins whispering to herself. She believes that a microchip has been implanted into her brain and that aliens are using this to ‘put things into my mind’. She describes how the aliens put impulses into her mind which she feels compelled to act upon. For 2 days the ‘alien impulses’ have concentrated on killing her mother and she is concerned that she may act upon these. She denies any hallucinations but during the interview appears to be responding to unseen auditory stimuli. She has little insight and does not accept that a relapse of her mental illness could be responsible for her current difficulties. There is no abnormality upon physical examination.","I need help getting this microchip removed from my brain. The aliens implanted it weeks ago so they can control my mind. They're using it to put things into my thoughts, putting impulses in there that I feel like I have to act on.  For the past two days, they've been putting impulses about killing my mother into my mind. I'm worried I might actually do what they're telling me to do. That's why I came here. I need to see a neurosurgeon to get this chip taken out.  The aliens are communicating with me through this device. They can put whatever they want into my head and make me think about doing things. It's been going on for weeks now since they put the chip in.  I don't understand why everyone keeps asking me about psychiatric history when this is clearly a medical problem. I have a foreign object in my brain that needs to be surgically removed. That's what I need help with."

7_a,"A 26-year-old man is referred to the crisis intervention home treatment team by his community psychiatric nurse. He is interviewed at home in the presence of his wife and 3-year-old child. He has turned the house upside down as he is convinced that there is a microphone taping his family conversations. He has been hugging his child, crying inconsolably. He can hear some ‘young lads down the road’ talking about killing him and his family. He feels that TV programmes are discussing him and his family. He has taped newspapers on the windows and has set up trip wires at the front and back doors. He has not slept for 3 days and has been talking to himself. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia at the age of 20 and was under the care of the Early Intervention Team for 3 years. He was treated with risperidone and seemed to have responded well. However, he stopped taking his medication and had a relapse 2 years ago. He was assigned a community psychiatric nurse as his care coordinator. Risperidone was re-commenced but he continued to remain paranoid and suspicious. There was concern about the possibility of him missing medication, and he was switched to risperidone long-acting depot. This was continued for over 12 months but without a significant response. Risperidone was replaced with olanzapine but this also did not produce a significant response and was associated with weight gain of 3 stones. Olanzapine was discontinued 3 months ago and he was prescribed aripiprazole. His wife insists that he has been compliant, but over the last 6 weeks his mental state has deteriorated. He appears very frightened and agitated. His eyes are darting and he is cowering on the sofa clutching his daughter, who is calm but looks frightened. He seems to be responding to unseen stimuli and occasionally mutters to himself. He says that voices describe what he is doing in a commentary. His mood is labile and he breaks down repeatedly. His speech is coherent and relevant. There is no formal thought disorder but he has delusions of persecution and reference. He does acknowledge that he has mental illness, but feels frustrated that his suspicions are not being taken seriously.","I've been searching the whole house because there's definitely a microphone hidden somewhere recording our family conversations. I need to find it to protect my wife and daughter. Those young lads down the road, I can hear them talking about killing me and my family. They're planning something and I need to stay alert.  The TV programs are discussing me and my family too. They're talking about us directly, mentioning things about our lives. That's why I put newspapers on all the windows so they can't see in anymore. I also set up trip wires at both doors so I'll know if anyone tries to get in.  I haven't been able to sleep for three days because I need to stay awake to protect them. There are voices that describe everything I'm doing, like a running commentary of my actions. I keep hearing them throughout the day.  I'm so scared for my daughter. I just want to hold her and keep her safe from all of this. I know I have a mental illness, but everyone thinks I'm just being paranoid. They're not taking these real threats seriously. The danger is real and I'm the only one who can see it. My wife tries to help but she doesn't understand what's actually happening around us."

Olanzapine was discontinued 3 months ago and he was prescribed aripiprazole. His wife insists that he has been compliant, but over the last 6 weeks his mental state has deteriorated. He appears very frightened and agitated. His eyes are darting and he is cowering on the sofa clutching his daughter, who is calm but looks frightened. He seems to be responding to unseen stimuli and occasionally mutters to himself. He says that voices describe what he is doing in a commentary. His mood is labile and he breaks down repeatedly. His speech is coherent and relevant. There is no formal thought disorder but he has delusions of persecution and reference. He does acknowledge that he has mental illness, but feels frustrated that his suspicions are not being taken seriously.","I've been searching the whole house because there's definitely a microphone hidden somewhere recording our family conversations. I need to find it to protect my wife and daughter. Those young lads down the road, I can hear them talking about killing me and my family. They're planning something and I need to stay alert. The TV programs are discussing me and my family too. They're talking about us directly, mentioning things about our lives. There are voices that describe everything I'm doing, like a running commentary of my actions. I keep hearing them throughout the day. I haven't been able to sleep for three days because I need to stay awake to protect them. I know I have a mental illness, but everyone thinks I'm just being paranoid. The danger is real and I'm the only one who can see it."
8_a,"You are asked to see a 40-year-old man in the emergency department who is deaf. He is with a British Sign Language (BSL) interpreter who has been called in urgently by the emergency staff. The man presented with a hearing female friend who told the receptionist that she was worried about her friend, because he had been acting strangely and had told her that he was ‘hearing voices’. The friend has to leave because she has to pick her children up from school, but she is still present when you arrive and he is happy for her to give some background information with him, which the interpreter signs. You discover that he has been deaf from birth, but has no other medical problems. He is single and works in a bakery on the early shift. He has a small group of friends with whom he has meals and goes to the pub. His parents who are hearing live nearby and are also supportive. He describes that for the last month he has been hearing voices. When you clarify this it transpires that what he means is that he sees images of the voice signing and lips moving, when there is no one around. He believes that they are real, and is clear that they are not his thoughts or in his mind. He does not hear any noises as such but he knows it is a male and says negative things very clearly such as ‘bad man’, ‘devil’ and ‘kill yourself’. On further enquiry he reports that he has been low in mood for the last 6 weeks since a relationship with a woman he has been seeing for 9 months broke down. He had hoped they would marry, but she is now pulling back from the relationship and says that she wants to be his friend. He is concerned that he may never get married. He makes good eye contact and watches you intently. You notice that he is very expressive with his face and that his face can be contorted at times as he communicates. He is also very expressive with his hands and the movements he makes are sometimes slow and sometimes very rapid. He seems on edge. He reports being ‘very sad’ and seems objectively low in mood. He is tearful when discussing his ex-girlfriend. He appears to be describing hallucinatory experiences, and you are clear that these are more than thoughts. He has no delusions of persecution or paranoid ideas, although is worried about his future. He has no thought passivity experiences (thought withdrawal, insertion or broadcast) nor any delusions of control. He is orientated in time, place and person.","I've been seeing these images for about a month now. There's this man who shows up and I can see him signing to me and his lips moving, even when there's nobody around. He's definitely real, not just thoughts in my head. He says really negative things to me like ""bad man"" and ""devil"" and ""kill yourself."" I know it's a male voice even though I don't actually hear sounds.  This all started after my relationship ended about six weeks ago. I was with this woman for nine months and I really thought we were going to get married. But now she's pulling back and just wants to be friends. It's made me really sad and I keep worrying that I might never find someone to marry.  I've been feeling very low since the breakup happened. My friend got concerned because I told her about the man I keep seeing who signs these awful things to me. She thought I should come get checked out because she was worried about how I've been acting lately.  I work the early shift at a bakery and I'm deaf, have been since I was born. I live alone but I have good friends and my parents live nearby. We go out for meals and to the pub together. Everything was going fine until this relationship fell apart and now I have this man showing up telling me these terrible things."

9_a,"A 79-year-old man presents with his family. They are concerned that his behaviour has become more unpredictable. He has also started to become more and more suspicious of all his family members, particularly his wife. He thinks she is poisoning him and will now no longer eat anything she has cooked. He does not even trust her to make him a drink. He has become more hostile and aggressive, which is a big change as he has always been a quiet-spoken and gentle man. His sleep is disturbed and his appetite has increased with some weight gain. He has no past psychiatric history. He has a complex medical history and his family report that he has most recently been treated for pulmonary fibrosis which had been relatively stable. However, following a bout of pneumonia his breathing was compromised so a new regime of medication was started. He is on 5 mg prednisolone three times daily and has been taking this for 6 weeks. The family report he had a course of steroids previously but did not have any side effects from it so they do not think it is causing problems. The patient is overweight and slightly breathless. He is clearly suspicious of his family watching and listening carefully. He does not hear well and you often have to repeat your questions. When you turn away to answer a question from his son, he immediately assumes that you and the family are plotting against him. His speech is fast but clear. His mood is difficult to assess as at times he seems fine but then will become quickly irritated. He admits he has had some auditory hallucinations which are somewhat unclear. The voices tell him to be careful of his wife as she is trying to kill him. He is convinced his children have started visiting more because they are in cahoots with his wife. He is also convinced that he could look after himself without any help from his family. He has not had any self-harm ideation or plans. He is orientated in time, place and person. His short-term memory is poor and he is easily frustrated when he becomes aware that he has got something wrong. He is not really aware of recent world or national events despite saying he reads the paper daily. He also admits that because he was more breathless he had increased his doses of prednisolone.","I need to be really careful around my wife because she's trying to poison me.

When I see them talking quietly or whispering, I know they're plotting something against me.

When I see them talking quietly or whispering, I know they're plotting something against me. Even when I was talking to the therapist, I could see them all scheming together when she turned away from me. I can hear voices that tell me to be careful of my husband because he's trying to kill me. They're looking out for me and warning me about what he's planning. I don't need all this help from my family. I can take care of myself just fine without them hovering around all the time. The whole situation with them suddenly being so involved is clearly part of whatever they're planning with my husband. Since I was having more trouble breathing, I've been taking extra doses of my prednisolone to help with that."
9_e,"A 79-year-old man presents with his family. They are concerned that his behaviour has become more unpredictable. He has also started to become more and more suspicious of all his family members, particularly his wife. He thinks she is poisoning him and will now no longer eat anything she has cooked. He does not even trust her to make him a drink. He has become more hostile and aggressive, which is a big change as he has always been a quiet-spoken and gentle man. His sleep is disturbed and his appetite has increased with some weight gain. He has no past psychiatric history. He has a complex medical history and his family report that he has most recently been treated for pulmonary fibrosis which had been relatively stable. However, following a bout of pneumonia his breathing was compromised so a new regime of medication was started. He is on 5 mg prednisolone three times daily and has been taking this for 6 weeks. The family report he had a course of steroids previously but did not have any side effects from it so they do not think it is causing problems. The patient is overweight and slightly breathless. He is clearly suspicious of his family watching and listening carefully. He does not hear well and you often have to repeat your questions. When you turn away to answer a question from his son, he immediately assumes that you and the family are plotting against him. His speech is fast but clear. His mood is difficult to assess as at times he seems fine but then will become quickly irritated. He admits he has had some auditory hallucinations which are somewhat unclear. The voices tell him to be careful of his wife as she is trying to kill him. He is convinced his children have started visiting more because they are in cahoots with his wife. He is also convinced that he could look after himself without any help from his family. He has not had any self-harm ideation or plans. He is orientated in time, place and person. His short-term memory is poor and he is easily frustrated when he becomes aware that he has got something wrong. He is not really aware of recent world or national events despite saying he reads the paper daily. He also admits that because he was more breathless he had increased his doses of prednisolone.","I need to be really careful around my wife because she's trying to poison me.

10_a,"A 73-year-old woman presents with a 6-month history of low mood. She had been previously relatively well and there were no major life events prior to her low mood. She had complained of being unable to sleep, unable to motivate herself to get out and about, and felt there was little hope things would ever be different. She had lost about 15 kg in weight in that period, with the last 10 kg having been lost in the last few weeks. She had been tried on fluoxetine but it had little effect. Over the last month she has developed features of psychosis with derogatory auditory hallucinations and delusions of worthlessness. She feels she should be left alone to die as she is not worth saving and other people are more deserving of the resources. She has denied any self-harm ideation but admits that she can see little point in being alive. Her food intake has gradually diminished and over the last few days she has barely eaten or drunk anything. When she was admitted she was very withdrawn and mute. No one was able to communicate with her.",I've been feeling really down for about six months now. I just can't sleep anymore and I don't have any motivation to get out and do things. There's no hope that anything will get better.  I can hear voices that say terrible things about me. They tell me how worthless I am and that I'm not worth saving. The voices are right though. Other people deserve the resources more than I do. I should just be left alone to die because that's what I deserve.  I don't really see the point in being alive anymore. I've been eating less and less because why bother? The last few days I haven't been eating or drinking much of anything. There's just no point in taking care of myself when I'm so worthless.  I know people are trying to talk to me but I don't have anything to say. What's the point of talking when you're not worth anyone's time anyway?
11_a,"A 68-year-old retired aircraft engineer presents to his general practitioner (GP) asking for help in removing an impostor from his home. He goes on to tell the GP that his wife was replaced by someone else 2 weeks ago but that this impostor is very clever and has managed to take on his wife’ s appearance, voice and mannerisms. He refuses to be in the same room as the impostor and frequently shouts at her to leave and return his real wife. He has also called the police to ask them to eject her from his home. His wife is distraught by this behaviour and despite her pleas and the intervention of other family members the patient refuses to believe that she is really his wife. He presents as a well-kempt elderly man who looks older than his chronological age. He makes normal eye contact. His speech is slow and repetitive and on occasions there are long pauses during which it appears he is struggling to find the appropriate word. His mood is normal and there is no evidence of depression. He is adamant that his wife has been replaced by an impostor but is unable to explain why or how this occurred. There is no formal thought disorder or hallucinations. On cognitive testing he scores 24 out of 30 on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) with particular deficits in the areas of registration and language.","I need help getting an impostor out of my house. Two weeks ago, someone replaced my wife with this other person. This impostor is extremely clever because she's managed to copy my wife's exact appearance, her voice, and even all her mannerisms. It's really quite remarkable how well she's done it, but I know it's not really her.  I won't stay in the same room with this person. When I see her, I tell her to leave and bring back my real wife. I've even called the police asking them to remove her from my home. My family keeps trying to tell me it's actually my wife, but they don't understand what's happening here. This impostor has them all fooled too.  I can't explain exactly how this replacement happened or why someone would do this, but I know what I'm seeing. My real wife is somewhere else, and this person needs to return her to me."

12_a,"A 15-year-old girl is presented by her mother. The girl has a 6-month history of becoming increasingly withdrawn and irritable. She is barely eating and wants to sleep all the time, complaining of being tired. She is no longer attending school as she cannot concentrate and cannot cope with having to deal with other people. She used to be a high achiever at school but recently her work has declined. Over the last few weeks her parents have become even more concerned as at times the girl appears to be talking to herself and has become acutely distressed and tearful for no obvious reason. Her mother reports that all was reasonably well up until 6 months ago. There were a number of family losses just before that time but she feels her daughter managed reasonably well. There is no particular family history of note. The mother is not aware of any substance misuse. The girl avoids eye contact and is non-communicative. She has psychomotor retardation but no waxy flexibility. She is dishevelled with uncombed hair and is wearing her bed clothes. She is socially detached. Her speech is slow and almost retarded. She appears not to hear what you are saying and often struggles to formulate a response. She says she feels ‘okay’ but is convinced that she does not deserve to live. When pushed she states she is worthless and this is confirmed by berating voices which continually confirm that self-belief of worthlessness. She avoids answering your questions about whether she has considered self-harm or whether she has made any attempts or plans. She is also convinced that everyone agrees with the voices. She is able to provide evidence of her worthlessness in aspects of her parents’ responses to her. She is orientated in person but not aware of the time of day or the day of the week.

She is aware she is at home but not sure of why she is seeing you.","** The voices tell me I don't deserve to live because I'm completely worthless all the time, and they're right about everything they say about me. They keep confirming what I already know about myself. I can tell from how my parents act around me that they know I'm worthless too. It's obvious. I know I'm at home right now but I'm not really sure why I'm talking to you."
13_a,"A 17-year-old man attends the accident and emergency department with his girlfriend. He lives with his parents, who do not know he is here. She says that for the last 4 weeks he has been seeing things that scare him in the night. He often cannot describe them but they are large shapes that move and are accompanied with strong sensations of fear. She says he does not want to see any of his friends and is worried that they hate him and want to do him some harm. He explains that he has had panic attacks during the day and regularly experiences palpitations. He has increased his previous use of cannabis because this helps him feel more relaxed. His girlfriend says that one day she came in and watched him from the door. She found him sitting, rocking and picking at his skin and seemed to be in a world of his own. He admits that he has always used a range of substances including alcohol, cannabis, MDMA (Ecstasy), methylphenidate, temazepam, ketamine and dexamfetamine. His girlfriend says that he does not want his parents to know he has come. He is dishevelled and smells strongly, as if he has not washed for a while. He is furtive and does not sit still. His eye contact is fleeting. Occasionally he wrings his hands or rocks and then stops as if checking himself. He glances up regularly at his girlfriend and the cubicle curtain. He turns abruptly several times and looks at the oxygen port on the cubicle wall, and when you ask him what he is looking at he says: ‘Can you hear that?’ When you ask about this he says: ‘mumbling and stuff’. You hear no noises of this nature. He looks frightened, and when asked says: ‘I feel like death, awful’. He has some paranoid ideas about his friends wanting to harm him. His girlfriend interrupts to say that his two best friends care about him and want to help him. He looks at her intently but does not reply. He says he has no intention to harm anyone or himself. His insight into his problems is limited.","For the past month I've been seeing these large shapes moving around at night that really scare me. They're just there, these big moving things that come with this overwhelming fear. My friends hate me now and want to hurt me, so I've been staying away from them. I don't want to see anyone really.  I've been having panic attacks during the day and my heart keeps racing. The cannabis helps me feel more relaxed though, so I've been using more of it. I use other stuff too when I need to, like alcohol, MDMA, pills, ketamine, whatever helps.  Right now I can hear mumbling and stuff. There's definitely sounds coming from somewhere. I feel like death, just awful. My friends are planning to do something to harm me, I know it. My girlfriend keeps saying they care about me but that's not what's really going on.  I don't want my parents finding out I'm here. They can't know about this."
