holdout_1,"A 79-year-old man presents with his family. They are concerned that his behaviour has become more unpredictable. He has also started to become more and more suspicious of all his family members, particularly his wife. He thinks she is poisoning him and will now no longer eat anything she has cooked. He does not even trust her to make him a drink. He has become more hostile and aggressive, which is a big change as he has always been a quiet-spoken and gentle man. His sleep is disturbed and his appetite has increased with some weight gain. He has no past psychiatric history. He has a complex medical history and his family report that he has most recently been treated for pulmonary fibrosis which had been relatively stable. However, following a bout of pneumonia his breathing was compromised so a new regime of medication was started. He is on 5 mg prednisolone three times daily and has been taking this for 6 weeks. The family report he had a course of steroids previously but did not have any side effects from it so they do not think it is causing problems. The patient is overweight and slightly breathless. He is clearly suspicious of his family watching and listening carefully. He does not hear well and you often have to repeat your questions. When you turn away to answer a question from his son, he immediately assumes that you and the family are plotting against him. His speech is fast but clear. His mood is difficult to assess as at times he seems fine but then will become quickly irritated. He admits he has had some auditory hallucinations which are somewhat unclear. The voices tell him to be careful of his wife as she is trying to kill him. He is convinced his children have started visiting more because they are in cahoots with his wife. He is also convinced that he could look after himself without any help from his family. He has not had any self-harm ideation or plans. He is orientated in time, place and person. His short-term memory is poor and he is easily frustrated when he becomes aware that he has got something wrong. He is not really aware of recent world or national events despite saying he reads the paper daily. He also admits that because he was more breathless he had increased his doses of prednisolone.","My wife has been trying to poison me. She's putting something in my food, so I won't eat anything she makes anymore. I can't even trust her to make me a simple drink. The voices I've been hearing have been warning me about this. They tell me to be careful because she's trying to kill me."
holdout_2,"A 73-year-old woman presents with a 6-month history of low mood. She had been previously relatively well and there were no major life events prior to her low mood. She had complained of being unable to sleep, unable to motivate herself to get out and about, and felt there was little hope things would ever be different. She had lost about 15 kg in weight in that period, with the last 10 kg having been lost in the last few weeks. She had been tried on fluoxetine but it had little effect. Over the last month she has developed features of psychosis with derogatory auditory hallucinations and delusions of worthlessness. She feels she should be left alone to die as she is not worth saving and other people are more deserving of the resources. She has denied any self-harm ideation but admits that she can see little point in being alive. Her food intake has gradually diminished and over the last few days she has barely eaten or drunk anything. When she was admitted she was very withdrawn and mute. No one was able to communicate with her.","Over the past month, I've been hearing voices that say awful things about me. I know I'm completely worthless and don't deserve to be saved. Other people deserve help and resources way more than I do. I should just be left alone to die."
holdout_3,"The patient says: 'The content of my delusions (e.g. being tested to see if I was 'good enough' for university) directly related to what I believed about myself, for instance that I was inferior to other people.'","Everyone around me is secretly testing me to see if I'm good enough for university. My peers are all in on it together, along with my teachers. They lay out these sneaky tests when we have conversations and they pretend as if they're just naturally asking me questions. They just want me to reveal how stupid I really am."
