"The patient was hospitalized after he presented at the Emergency Department with delusions of persecution and auditory hallucinations (“There are people who want me dead because of my soul, they want to collect my psychic energy”, “I can hear them through the walls, day and night, they are plotting against me, and they are saying bad things about my family”, “They are forcing me to do evil things, like cursing strangers with no reason”). These manifestations led to changes in his behavior, he became reclusive, didn’t go out of his house for weeks and spoke with his family only by phone, refusing to see them (“I can protect them if I’m not seen with them”). He recently abandoned his job as a salesman and didn’t want to see her girlfriend anymore because of the belief that she was in cahoots with the persecutors who want him dead.",1,1,"There are people who want me dead because of my soul - they want to collect my psychic energy. I can hear them through the walls, day and night, plotting against me and saying bad things about my family. They're forcing me to do evil things, like cursing strangers for no reason.

I haven't left my house in weeks because I need to stay safe. I only talk to my family on the phone now because I can protect them better if I'm not seen with them. I had to quit my sales job recently because it wasn't safe to be out there anymore. 

I also had to stop seeing my girlfriend because I found out she's working with the people who want me dead. It's hard but I can't trust her anymore - she's in cahoots with them.",,,,,,
"The patient was diagnosed for the first time with acute psychotic disorder 3 months ago. Her symptoms at hospital admission consisted in psychomotor agitation, grandiose *“I am very powerful, and I can make any wish come true, like Santa Claus, only better”) and persecutory (“there is a group of forces trying to kill me and take my powers”) delusions, auditory and visual hallucinations (“I can hear them talking about me and trying to make me feel miserable… they are cursing me and telling lies about me and my family”, “They are moving through the light, I can see them… they are like some green shadows”)",1,2,"I'm very powerful and can make any wish come true, like Santa Claus, only better.

"A 24-year-old man presents to casualty having got into a fight as he thought he was being watched and felt threatened. He appears to have fractured his thumb but is reluctant to let you examine him or order an X-ray. He looks suspicious and wary. When asked about his concerns he says that over the last few months he has been carefully monitored by government agencies. He has been hearing a voice out loud giving a running commentary on his thoughts and these are being broadcast to the government. Any machine enables the government to get inside his head and the voice is telling him it would be unwise to face the X-ray machine. The voice is not one that he recognizes, and it is sometimes derogatory, telling him he is stupid for giving his thoughts away for free. Initially the voice came and went but over the last few weeks it is present almost constantly and he cannot always sleep because even when he sleeps the voice comments on what he is thinking. He is exhausted. The man is absolutely convinced that the government is after him but he cannot explain why. There is no previous history and he denies any substance use. Until a few weeks ago he had been working as a kitchen assistant but was sacked for leaving jobs unfinished. There is no family history of any psychiatric illness. The man looks unkempt. He is wary and looks quite frightened and agitated. His eye contact is fleeting and he constantly looks around him in a perplexed manner. His speech is rambling and he does not express himself coherently. He occasionally uses words that you have not heard before and repeats them as though they have some significance. He does not come across as depressed. He has delusions of persecution. He has auditory hallucinations that provide a running commentary on every aspect of his behaviour. He has thought broadcast and thought withdrawal.",2,3,"I got into a fight because I was being watched and felt threatened, so I hurt my thumb. I don't want to get an X-ray though because machines let the government get inside my head, and the voice is telling me it would be unwise to face that machine.

For the last few months, government agencies have been carefully monitoring me. There's this voice I hear out loud that gives a running commentary on my thoughts, and these thoughts are being broadcast to the government. I don't recognize the voice, and sometimes it's really mean to me, calling me stupid for giving my thoughts away for free.

At first the voice would come and go, but over the last few weeks it's there almost constantly. I can't even sleep properly anymore because even when I'm sleeping, the voice comments on what I'm thinking. I'm completely exhausted from it.

I know the government is after me, though I can't really explain why they would be. Until a few weeks ago I was working as a kitchen assistant, but I got fired for leaving jobs unfinished. I guess it's hard to focus on work when you have this voice constantly commenting on everything you're doing and thinking.

The whole situation has me feeling pretty on edge. I keep having to look around because you never know who might be watching or what they might be planning.",,,,,,
"A 21-year-old man presents in an extremely frightened state. He is absolutely convinced that he has been followed and his life is at risk. When walking through town he was sure people were watching him, talking about him and planning how to kill him. He can trust no one including his friends. He has come to the hospital rather than go to the police because he believes the police are behind the conspiracy. He believes they have installed surveillance cameras in his flat and have been watching him. He feels others are jealous of his talents and success. He is convinced he has special powers and that is how he found out about the plots against him. He has had to start carrying a knife so he can protect himself from all his enemies. The man has had no previous contact with psychiatric services and he has no medical history of note. All was well until the last few days. His sister recalls that about 6 weeks ago her brother and a few friends went to a music festival. She is aware that his friends have smoked cannabis and taken Ecstasy (E), but she thinks it is unlikely that her brother joined them. He does not smoke and has no prescribed medications. The man is about to begin his final year at university. He has been studying physics and philosophy at university. He and his girlfriend finished their relationship just before the music festival. It was a reasonably amicable breakup, but had been a 3-year intense relationship. His interests include music and computer games. He has a good group of friends although over the last few days he has been avoiding them as he feels threatened by them. He is clearly frightened and suspicious, constantly looking around and trying to check what is going on. He makes intense eye contact when not looking elsewhere. He struggles to focus on the interview. His speech is rapid and his thoughts are not coherent. He jumps around from topic to topic. His mood is labile in that at times he seems to settle down but then quickly becomes alert and appears to be overactive. He has delusions of persecution and rather grandiose ideas about his own skills. He has auditory hallucinations, which tell him that he should kill if he needs to. He thinks the cameras in his house are being used to monitor his thoughts but he does not quite have thought withdrawal. He does not have any self-harm ideation. He is orientated in person in that he knows who he is, but he is not orientated in time or place. His short-term memory is poor and his long term recall is variable as he is easily distracted.",2,4,"I'm really scared right now and I need help, but I don't know who I can trust. For the past few days, people have been following me everywhere I go. When I walk through town, I can see them watching me and talking about each other - they're planning how to kill me. I can't even trust my friends anymore because they're part of it too.

I came here to the hospital instead of going to the police because the police are the ones behind this whole conspiracy. They've put surveillance cameras in my flat and they're watching everything I do. They're even using those cameras to monitor my thoughts somehow. I know this is all happening because people are jealous of my talents and what I've accomplished. 

The thing is, I have special powers that let me figure out these plots against me. That's how I discovered what they're planning. I've had to start carrying a knife with me so I can protect myself from all these enemies who want to hurt me.

Everything was fine until just a few days ago. I'm supposed to start my final year at university soon - I study physics and philosophy. My girlfriend and I broke up about six weeks ago, right before I went to a music festival with some friends. It was a three-year relationship, but the breakup was okay, not too messy or anything.

I usually hang out with a good group of friends and I'm into music and computer games, but lately I've been avoiding everyone because I feel threatened by them. There are voices telling me that I should kill if I need to defend myself. I keep having to look around and check what's happening because I never know where the danger might come from.",,,,,,
"A 23-year-old electrical goods salesman attends his general practitioner (GP) surgery with his mother. He is very articulate but reluctant to talk, insisting that only the police can really help him. He explains that over the past 6 months his boss and his colleagues have conspired against him. Initially this was to dismiss him from his job but over the past few weeks they have conspired to kill him. He feels that they have been monitoring his activities and have even gone to the extent of bugging his flat and tapping his mobile phone. He is absolutely convinced of this and shows you some marks on the phone as evidence of it having been tampered with. He insists, politely, that he will not allow a physical examination as this may present an opportunity to implant a microchip. In fact he is very worried that an old dental filling may be a transmitting device. He is preoccupied with these thoughts and is unable to distract himself. At work he feels constantly bombarded by his colleagues’ nasty comments about him. He can hear them clearly even across the showroom. On one occasion he clearly heard derogatory voices from his manager’s office on the other side of the building. He also knows that colleagues talk about him because of the way the price labels are arranged. His work has been affected. His boss has given him a performance warning and he sees this as further evidence of his boss’s antipathy towards him. He feels that ‘direct action’ is now needed but he refuses to discuss this. He has contacted the police who have spoken to his colleagues. His mother indicates that the police say his colleagues admitted talking about him because his behaviour has been strange, but according to the police the charges of conspiracy are baseless and they have asked him to seek psychiatric help. His mother feels that his concerns are ‘over the top’ but does not feel that her son is ‘psychotic’. She feels that he is under a lot of stress following a break-up with his girlfriend 6 months ago and pressure at work. His mother requests medication for him. He flatly refuses, but says that he will consider it if you ‘endorse’ his letter to the local Member of Parliament and the Prime Minister about the refusal of the local police to help him.",2,5,"Look, I really need help but not the kind of medical help everyone keeps pushing on me. What I need is someone to take action against what's happening at work. Over the past 6 months, my boss and colleagues have been conspiring against me. At first they just wanted to get me fired, but now it's gotten much more serious - they're actually planning to kill me.

They've been watching everything I do. They bugged my apartment and they're tapping my phone - I can show you the marks on it where they tampered with it. That's why I can't let you examine me because they might try to plant a microchip on me. I'm even worried that one of my old dental fillings might actually be some kind of transmitting device they put in.

At work, I can hear my colleagues making nasty comments about me from all the way across the showroom. One time I clearly heard voices talking about me coming from my manager's office on the other side of the building. They also communicate about me through how they arrange the price labels - it's like a code system.

My boss gave me a performance warning recently, which just proves how much he has it out for me. I think direct action is needed at this point, but I don't want to get into specifics about that.

I contacted the police and they talked to my colleagues, but they're not taking the conspiracy seriously. They want me to get psychiatric help instead of investigating properly. That's why I need someone to endorse my letter to our Member of Parliament and the Prime Minister about how the local police are refusing to help me. If you'll do that, then maybe I'd consider taking medication, but otherwise I don't see how pills are going to solve this situation.",,,,,,
"A 30-year-old shop assistant presents to the emergency department requesting that they remove the microchip from her brain. She says that this chip was implanted into her brain some weeks ago in order that aliens could control her mind. She has previously been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and has had a number of previous admissions to psychiatric hospitals, the majority of which have been involuntary admissions. She has previously been treated with a number of different types of antipsychotic medications, and this is currently olanzapine 20 mg once daily. Her last admission to hospital was 6 months ago and since this time she has often missed her medication. She has no past medical history of note. There is no family history of mental illness. She is currently living with her parents who are supportive of her. From the ages of 18 to 28 she smoked high-potency cannabis (‘skunk’) on an almost daily basis, but following advice and support from her community mental health team she has successfully cut down her use of cannabis to approximately once every month. She has no other history of alcohol or illicit substance abuse. Although she has no previous convictions she has previously assaulted her parents and ward nursing staff when psychotic. She presents as unkempt and is surprised that she is being asked about her previous psychiatric history rather than being referred to a neurosurgeon for removal of the microchip. Despite this it is possible to establish a good rapport. At several points during the interview she stops speaking in mid-sentence and stares intently into one of the corners of the room and begins whispering to herself. She believes that a microchip has been implanted into her brain and that aliens are using this to ‘put things into my mind’. She describes how the aliens put impulses into her mind which she feels compelled to act upon. For 2 days the ‘alien impulses’ have concentrated on killing her mother and she is concerned that she may act upon these. She denies any hallucinations but during the interview appears to be responding to unseen auditory stimuli. She has little insight and does not accept that a relapse of her mental illness could be responsible for her current difficulties. There is no abnormality upon physical examination.",2,6,"I need someone to remove the microchip from my brain. A few weeks ago, aliens implanted this chip so they could control my mind, and I need it taken out by a neurosurgeon.

The aliens are using this chip to put things into my mind - impulses that I feel compelled to act on. For the past two days, these alien impulses have been focused on killing my mother, and I'm worried I might actually do it. That's why I need this chip removed as soon as possible.

I don't understand why everyone keeps asking me about my psychiatric history instead of just referring me to someone who can take this thing out of my head. This is a medical problem that needs a surgical solution.

I work as a shop assistant and live with my parents, who are really supportive. I used to smoke cannabis pretty much daily from when I was 18 until I was 28, but I've cut way back now - maybe once a month at most. My community mental health team helped me with that.

I don't really take my medication regularly anymore. I know I'm supposed to, but I often forget or miss doses. My last hospital stay was about six months ago.

The voices keep talking to me, especially when I look toward that corner over there. I have to stop and listen to what they're saying sometimes. But the main issue is still this microchip - that's what's causing all of this and why I'm here.",,,,,,
"A 26-year-old man is referred to the crisis intervention home treatment team by his community psychiatric nurse. He is interviewed at home in the presence of his wife and 3-year-old child. He has turned the house upside down as he is convinced that there is a microphone taping his family conversations. He has been hugging his child, crying inconsolably. He can hear some ‘young lads down the road’ talking about killing him and his family. He feels that TV programmes are discussing him and his family. He has taped newspapers on the windows and has set up trip wires at the front and back doors. He has not slept for 3 days and has been talking to himself. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia at the age of 20 and was under the care of the Early Intervention Team for 3 years. He was treated with risperidone and seemed to have responded well. However, he stopped taking his medication and had a relapse 2 years ago. He was assigned a community psychiatric nurse as his care coordinator. Risperidone was re-commenced but he continued to remain paranoid and suspicious. There was concern about the possibility of him missing medication, and he was switched to risperidone long-acting depot. This was continued for over 12 months but without a significant response. Risperidone was replaced with olanzapine but this also did not produce a significant response and was associated with weight gain of 3 stones. Olanzapine was discontinued 3 months ago and he was prescribed aripiprazole. His wife insists that he has been compliant, but over the last 6 weeks his mental state has deteriorated. He appears very frightened and agitated. His eyes are darting and he is cowering on the sofa clutching his daughter, who is calm but looks frightened. He seems to be responding to unseen stimuli and occasionally mutters to himself. He says that voices describe what he is doing in a commentary. His mood is labile and he breaks down repeatedly. His speech is coherent and relevant. There is no formal thought disorder but he has delusions of persecution and reference. He does acknowledge that he has mental illness, but feels frustrated that his suspicions are not being taken seriously.",2,7,"I'm really scared right now. There's a microphone hidden somewhere in my house - I know someone is recording everything we say as a family. I've been searching everywhere trying to find it, had to move furniture around and check everything. 

I can hear these young guys who live down the road, and they're talking about killing me and my family. It's terrifying. Even when I'm watching TV, the programs are talking about me and my family - they know things about us. I had to put newspapers up on all the windows and set up some wires by the doors to protect us.

I haven't been able to sleep for three days now. I keep hearing voices that tell me exactly what I'm doing, like they're commenting on everything. Sometimes I find myself talking back to them or just talking to myself.

I'm so worried about my daughter and what might happen to us. I just want to hold her and keep her safe, but I get so emotional thinking about the danger we're in. My wife tries to help but I don't think she fully understands how serious this is.

I know I have a mental illness, and I've been taking my medication like I'm supposed to. But what's really frustrating is that nobody seems to believe me when I tell them about these real threats. They act like I'm just imagining things, but I can hear what I hear and I know what's happening. I wish people would take my concerns seriously instead of just dismissing them.",,,,,,
"You are asked to see a 40-year-old man in the emergency department who is deaf. He is with a British Sign Language (BSL) interpreter who has been called in urgently by the emergency staff. The man presented with a hearing female friend who told the receptionist that she was worried about her friend, because he had been acting strangely and had told her that he was ‘hearing voices’. The friend has to leave because she has to pick her children up from school, but she is still present when you arrive and he is happy for her to give some background information with him, which the interpreter signs. You discover that he has been deaf from birth, but has no other medical problems. He is single and works in a bakery on the early shift. He has a small group of friends with whom he has meals and goes to the pub. His parents who are hearing live nearby and are also supportive. He describes that for the last month he has been hearing voices. When you clarify this it transpires that what he means is that he sees images of the voice signing and lips moving, when there is no one around. He believes that they are real, and is clear that they are not his thoughts or in his mind. He does not hear any noises as such but he knows it is a male and says negative things very clearly such as ‘bad man’, ‘devil’ and ‘kill yourself’. On further enquiry he reports that he has been low in mood for the last 6 weeks since a relationship with a woman he has been seeing for 9 months broke down. He had hoped they would marry, but she is now pulling back from the relationship and says that she wants to be his friend. He is concerned that he may never get married. He makes good eye contact and watches you intently. You notice that he is very expressive with his face and that his face can be contorted at times as he communicates. He is also very expressive with his hands and the movements he makes are sometimes slow and sometimes very rapid. He seems on edge. He reports being ‘very sad’ and seems objectively low in mood. He is tearful when discussing his ex-girlfriend. He appears to be describing hallucinatory experiences, and you are clear that these are more than thoughts. He has no delusions of persecution or paranoid ideas, although is worried about his future. He has no thought passivity experiences (thought withdrawal, insertion or broadcast) nor any delusions of control. He is orientated in time, place and person.",2,8,"For the past month, I've been seeing someone signing to me when no one is actually there. I can see the images of this voice - a man signing with his lips moving very clearly. He says negative things like ""bad man,"" ""devil,"" and ""kill yourself."" These aren't my thoughts or something in my mind - they're real and I can see them happening.

This all started about six weeks ago when my relationship fell apart. I'd been with this woman for nine months and I really thought we were going to get married. But now she's pulling back and just wants to be friends. I'm very sad about it and I cry when I think about her. I'm worried I might never get married.

I've been feeling really low since the breakup. My friend got concerned because I told her about seeing these voices, so she brought me here. I work the early shift at a bakery and I have a good group of friends I eat with and go to the pub with. My parents live nearby and they're supportive too. I've been deaf since birth but otherwise I'm healthy.

I'm just really struggling right now with everything that's happened. The sadness from losing the relationship and now seeing this man signing these horrible things to me - it's a lot to deal with.",,,,,,
"A 79-year-old man presents with his family. They are concerned that his behaviour has become more unpredictable. He has also started to become more and more suspicious of all his family members, particularly his wife. He thinks she is poisoning him and will now no longer eat anything she has cooked. He does not even trust her to make him a drink. He has become more hostile and aggressive, which is a big change as he has always been a quiet-spoken and gentle man. His sleep is disturbed and his appetite has increased with some weight gain. He has no past psychiatric history. He has a complex medical history and his family report that he has most recently been treated for pulmonary fibrosis which had been relatively stable. However, following a bout of pneumonia his breathing was compromised so a new regime of medication was started. He is on 5 mg prednisolone three times daily and has been taking this for 6 weeks. The family report he had a course of steroids previously but did not have any side effects from it so they do not think it is causing problems. The patient is overweight and slightly breathless. He is clearly suspicious of his family watching and listening carefully. He does not hear well and you often have to repeat your questions. When you turn away to answer a question from his son, he immediately assumes that you and the family are plotting against him. His speech is fast but clear. His mood is difficult to assess as at times he seems fine but then will become quickly irritated. He admits he has had some auditory hallucinations which are somewhat unclear. The voices tell him to be careful of his wife as she is trying to kill him. He is convinced his children have started visiting more because they are in cahoots with his wife. He is also convinced that he could look after himself without any help from his family. He has not had any self-harm ideation or plans. He is orientated in time, place and person. His short-term memory is poor and he is easily frustrated when he becomes aware that he has got something wrong. He is not really aware of recent world or national events despite saying he reads the paper daily. He also admits that because he was more breathless he had increased his doses of prednisolone.",2,9,"I've been having some real problems with my wife lately. She's been trying to poison me - I'm absolutely sure of it. I won't eat anything she cooks anymore, and I won't even let her make me drinks because I don't trust what she might put in them. 

My kids have been coming around a lot more often recently, and I know it's because they're working together with my wife against me. They think I can't see what's going on, but I can take care of myself just fine without any of their so-called help.

I've been hearing voices that warn me to be careful of my wife because she's trying to kill me. They're right - I need to stay alert and watch out for what she's doing.

Everyone's been acting like my behavior is different, but I'm just protecting myself from what's really happening. I get irritated when people don't understand the situation I'm dealing with.

My sleep hasn't been great lately, and I've been eating more and gaining some weight. My breathing got worse after I had pneumonia, so I've been taking extra doses of my medication to help with that. 

I'm having trouble remembering things sometimes, which is frustrating, especially when I get something wrong. I try to keep up with the news by reading the paper every day, but it's hard to focus on all that stuff when I have more important things to worry about at home.",,,,,,
"A 73-year-old woman presents with a 6-month history of low mood. She had been previously relatively well and there were no major life events prior to her low mood. She had complained of being unable to sleep, unable to motivate herself to get out and about, and felt there was little hope things would ever be different. She had lost about 15 kg in weight in that period, with the last 10 kg having been lost in the last few weeks. She had been tried on fluoxetine but it had little effect. Over the last month she has developed features of psychosis with derogatory auditory hallucinations and delusions of worthlessness. She feels she should be left alone to die as she is not worth saving and other people are more deserving of the resources. She has denied any self-harm ideation but admits that she can see little point in being alive. Her food intake has gradually diminished and over the last few days she has barely eaten or drunk anything. When she was admitted she was very withdrawn and mute. No one was able to communicate with her.",2,10,"I've been feeling really down for about six months now. It started out of nowhere - nothing bad happened or anything, I just started feeling terrible.

I've lost a lot of weight, maybe 15 kilograms total. The last 10 came off really quickly in just a few weeks. I tried some medication but it didn't help at all.

Over the past month, I've been hearing voices that say awful things about me. I know I'm completely worthless and don't deserve to be saved. Other people deserve help and resources way more than I do. I should just be left alone to die. 

I don't want to hurt myself, but I honestly don't see the point in being alive. I've been eating less and less, and the last few days I've barely had any food or water. When I got to the hospital, I just couldn't talk to anyone anymore. There's nothing to say.",,,,,,
"A 68-year-old retired aircraft engineer presents to his general practitioner (GP) asking for help in removing an impostor from his home. He goes on to tell the GP that his wife was replaced by someone else 2 weeks ago but that this impostor is very clever and has managed to take on his wife’ s appearance, voice and mannerisms. He refuses to be in the same room as the impostor and frequently shouts at her to leave and return his real wife. He has also called the police to ask them to eject her from his home. His wife is distraught by this behaviour and despite her pleas and the intervention of other family members the patient refuses to believe that she is really his wife. He presents as a well-kempt elderly man who looks older than his chronological age. He makes normal eye contact. His speech is slow and repetitive and on occasions there are long pauses during which it appears he is struggling to find the appropriate word. His mood is normal and there is no evidence of depression. He is adamant that his wife has been replaced by an impostor but is unable to explain why or how this occurred. There is no formal thought disorder or hallucinations. On cognitive testing he scores 24 out of 30 on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) with particular deficits in the areas of registration and language.",2,11,"I need help getting this impostor out of my house.

"A 15-year-old girl is presented by her mother. The girl has a 6-month history of becoming increasingly withdrawn and irritable. She is barely eating and wants to sleep all the time, complaining of being tired. She is no longer attending school as she cannot concentrate and cannot cope with having to deal with other people. She used to be a high achiever at school but recently her work has declined. Over the last few weeks her parents have become even more concerned as at times the girl appears to be talking to herself and has become acutely distressed and tearful for no obvious reason. Her mother reports that all was reasonably well up until 6 months ago. There were a number of family losses just before that time but she feels her daughter managed reasonably well. There is no particular family history of note. The mother is not aware of any substance misuse. The girl avoids eye contact and is non-communicative. She has psychomotor retardation but no waxy flexibility. She is dishevelled with uncombed hair and is wearing her bed clothes. She is socially detached. Her speech is slow and almost retarded. She appears not to hear what you are saying and often struggles to formulate a response. She says she feels ‘okay’ but is convinced that she does not deserve to live. When pushed she states she is worthless and this is confirmed by berating voices which continually confirm that self-belief of worthlessness. She avoids answering your questions about whether she has considered self-harm or whether she has made any attempts or plans. She is also convinced that everyone agrees with the voices. She is able to provide evidence of her worthlessness in aspects of her parents’ responses to her. She is orientated in person but not aware of the time of day or the day of the week. She is aware she is at home but not sure of why she is seeing you.",2,12,"I've been feeling really tired for the past few months and just want to sleep all the time.

The voices are always there telling me how worthless I am, and they're right. I don't deserve to live. Everyone around me agrees with what the voices are saying - I can tell from how my parents act around me. They confirm everything the voices tell me about myself.

I feel okay I guess, but I know I'm worthless. The voices make sure I understand that. I can see it in how people respond to me too. My parents' reactions show me it's all true.

She says that for the last 4 weeks he has been seeing things that scare him in the night. He often cannot describe them but they are large shapes that move and are accompanied with strong sensations of fear. She says he does not want to see any of his friends and is worried that they hate him and want to do him some harm. He explains that he has had panic attacks during the day and regularly experiences palpitations. He has increased his previous use of cannabis because this helps him feel more relaxed. His girlfriend says that one day she came in and watched him from the door. She found him sitting, rocking and picking at his skin and seemed to be in a world of his own. He admits that he has always used a range of substances including alcohol, cannabis, MDMA (Ecstasy), methylphenidate, temazepam, ketamine and dexamfetamine. His girlfriend says that he does not want his parents to know he has come. He is dishevelled and smells strongly, as if he has not washed for a while. He is furtive and does not sit still. His eye contact is fleeting. Occasionally he wrings his hands or rocks and then stops as if checking himself. He glances up regularly at his girlfriend and the cubicle curtain. He turns abruptly several times and looks at the oxygen port on the cubicle wall, and when you ask him what he is looking at he says: ‘Can you hear that?’ When you ask about this he says: ‘mumbling and stuff’. You hear no noises of this nature. He looks frightened, and when asked says: ‘I feel like death, awful’. He has some paranoid ideas about his friends wanting to harm him. His girlfriend interrupts to say that his two best friends care about him and want to help him. He looks at her intently but does not reply. He says he has no intention to harm anyone or himself. His insight into his problems is limited.",2,13,"I've been having a really rough time lately. For the past month or so, I've been seeing these large shapes moving around at night that really scare me. They're hard to describe exactly, but they're definitely there and they fill me with this intense fear. 

My friends have been acting different toward me - I can tell they hate me and want to hurt me somehow. That's why I've been avoiding them completely. I don't want to see any of them right now.

During the day I keep having these panic attacks and my heart races all the time. The only thing that helps me feel more relaxed is smoking more cannabis than I used to. I use other stuff too - alcohol, MDMA, some prescription meds, ketamine - whatever I can get really.

Sometimes I just sit and rock back and forth while picking at my skin. It helps somehow. Right now I can hear mumbling and voices - can you hear that too? There's definitely something making noise.

I feel absolutely terrible, like death really. Everything feels awful. My girlfriend brought me here but I really don't want my parents finding out about any of this. I'm not going to hurt myself or anyone else, but I just feel so scared and awful all the time.",,,,,,
"Andrew walks in to the clinic, clutching a carrier bag, beaming. Despite his many personal challenges, depression has never been a feature of Andrew’s presentation. Today however, he is positively upbeat and clearly desperate to show me what is in the bag. ‘I’ve got it doc, I’ve got proof! Once you see this you will know I am a psychic’. Andrew produces a slightly dog-eared certificate, issued by one of the growing 24-hour psychic TV channels, certifying that he is a Medium. Andrew has paid £1000 for this, and with further investment he tells me he will be allowed to receive live calls from the public for telepathic readings. Andrew believes that his talents have brought him to the attention of MI5 and the CIA, who are working together to put him through psychic training by ‘telepathically torturing’ him until an undefined point in the future, when he will have passed their initiation, and become a member of an elite telepathic spy ring. His feels this job on TV will keep him busy until this day, and his destiny is revealed. His beliefs have been firm for nearly 5 years. The torture he experiences takes place by way of the secret services moving various organs in his body, with a considerable amount of perceived pain, and by them inducing sensations in his rectum and bowels of being raped, together with many voices and tactile hallucina-tions of being punched, touched and at times even tickled. Like the back pay from his disability benefits payment, Andrew uses his latest piece of evidence to reinforce his beliefs and with a kind, benevolent disposition takes the clinical teams continued non-committed response as a further sign that the conspiracy is indeed well hidden. We are mere pawns in the bigger game.",3,14,"I finally got the proof I needed! I just got my certificate that officially makes me a Medium from one of the psychic TV channels. It cost me £1000, but it was totally worth it because now I have documentation of my abilities. They're going to let me take live calls from people who want telepathic readings once I invest a bit more.

The thing is, MI5 and the CIA have been working together because they noticed my psychic talents. They've been putting me through this intense telepathic training program for about five years now. It's pretty brutal - they're preparing me to join this elite spy ring of telepaths. Until that happens and my real destiny gets revealed, this TV psychic job will keep me busy.

The training they put me through is no joke. They can move my organs around inside my body, and it causes a lot of pain. They also make me feel like I'm being violated in my rectum and bowels. I hear voices constantly, and they make me feel like I'm being punched, touched, even tickled sometimes. It's all part of toughening me up for when I officially become one of their telepathic spies.

I know this whole operation is really well hidden because even the medical staff here can't acknowledge what's happening. They have to play dumb about it - they're just pawns in this bigger game that's going on. But now with this certificate, I have real evidence of what I've been telling everyone.",,,,,,

This belief was not even shaken when a doctor looked in my ears and confirmed (surprise, surprise) that there weren’t any bugs in there.”",3,15,"I can control these microphones in my ears - I'm able to switch them on and off whenever I want.

"The patient says: “It’s like being possessed, you know. What can you do? What can you really do?’ It’s like I’m being held down. I’m constantly caged in by voices, my body will recognise it.

"The patient says: “I don’t know what kind of game they’re playing but someone’s gonna end up getting hurt really bad if they keep it up, whether it’s me or them. There must be a camera in the TV then, I mean I don’t give a shit. Is there a solution, has someone else gone through this, is there information on what I’m going through? I’ve experienced it for a good long time on my own because I was embarrassed by it so I did go on the internet. Made me think... is this really happening... I mean are these people being watched or something. That’s probably why they’re using voices that you recognise from back in the day and it’s like “We use these to try to connect”. “",3,17,"I don't know what kind of game they're playing but someone's gonna end up getting hurt really bad if they keep it up, whether it's me or them. There must be a camera in the TV then, I mean I don't give a shit. 

I've been dealing with this for a good long time on my own because I was embarrassed by it. I finally went on the internet to see if there's a solution, if someone else has gone through this, if there's information on what I'm going through.

It made me think about whether these people are being watched or something. That's probably why they're using voices that you recognize from back in the day - they use these to try to connect with you.

Is this really happening? Has anyone else experienced this?",,,,,,
"The patient says: “The content of my delusions (e.g. being tested to see if I was ‘good enough’ for university) directly related to what I believed about myself, for instance that I was inferior to other people.”",3,18,"I've been going through some really tough times lately. I keep feeling like I'm being tested to see if I'm good enough for university. It's been weighing on me constantly because I've always felt like I'm not as good as other people - like I'm somehow inferior to everyone around me. 

These feelings about being tested are directly connected to how I see myself. When I think about myself compared to others, I just feel like I don't measure up. It's like everything that's happening to me right now is tied to these deep beliefs I have about not being good enough.",,,,,,
"The patient says: “MI5 are training me. There is a reason for everything I’ve been through. I will be rewarded, money, in the end, for what’s been done to me. I don’t want to have to do the work, I’d rather have a quiet life, but if I have to do this, then maybe at least they will reward me.”",3,19,"I'm being trained by MI5 right now. Everything that's happened to me has been part of this bigger plan - there's a reason behind all of it. They're going to compensate me financially when this is all over for what I've had to go through. 

Honestly, I'd prefer to just live quietly and not have to deal with any of this work they want me to do. But since I'm already involved and have to go through with it, I figure at least I should get something out of it in the end.",,,,,,
